          <br />
          <p>
            I recently graduated at the University of Denver studying{' '}
            <i>
                Computer Science / Business Administration / Finance.
            </i>{' '}
            I was born and raised in Colorado and don't plan on leaving any time soon!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Right now, I'm enjoying some time off after graduating, spending
            some time traveling, experimenting, building, spending time with
            friends, etc. I'm also challenging myself to improve my skills as a solo software developer
            by collaborating with businesses local to the DU area and building software solutions for them when I have the time! 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I enjoy working on creative web tools and creating engaging
            experiences through technology. I'm most interested in working on
            educational technology and examining how we can facilitate social
            connection through data.
